        In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and
        Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western
        coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran
        India's northern plains,[44] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate,
        and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval
        Islam.[45] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a
        long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46] In the Punjab,
        Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47] The Mughal
        Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48] leaving
        a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49] Gradually expanding rule of
        the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial
        economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule
        began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted
        slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern
        ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and
        influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent
        resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55]
        In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent
        dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a
        Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and
        an unprecedented migration.[60]
